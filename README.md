# kinderYA!
A coding boot-camp final project by Meir Pechthalt, Tamir Kitay and myself. 
A full scale kindergarden management app designed to help prevent the chance of children being forgotten in cars by establishing a visual represebtation of presence. Clear markings make sure anyone glancing at the screen can instantly recognize any present or absent kids. The system will highlight missing kids at a certain time of the day, and will restart automatically.
A full CRUDL system allows the staff to add, delete, update and view the kindergarden's roster. Some special features such as filters and sort are available.
Parents may also log from a far and send notes to the kindergarden teacher, or send emojis to their screens which will be shown.

This app is build with advanced technologies featuring ES6 JS, Vue Js, responsive design ect. This app is A single page application and a progressive web application.
